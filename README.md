# My Portfolio
Hi this is a my portfolio hosted by Github Pages by using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). This is a project modified from **Agency theme based on [Agency bootstrap theme ](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/)**

## How to use
- Frok this repository.
- Rename the repository to ```username.github.io```.
- Clone/Pull your newly created repository to your pc.
- Now you may make changes 
  - Update the [_config.yml](/_config.yml) file and fill the contents accordingly.
  - Some contents like Education and Achievements information must be updated in the html file itself. i.e., in the [_includes Directory](/_includes/).
  - Projects can be added and modified from the [_posts Directory](/_posts/).
  - Images can be found in [img Directory](/img/)
  - If you need a section add it as ```sectionname.html``` in the [_includes Directory](/_includes/) and don't forget to include it in the [default.html](/_layouts/default.html). The same applies for, when you rename or remove a html file.
